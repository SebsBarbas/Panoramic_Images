# Code disposition
All relevant code is written under the `src` directory. There you can find imagenes_panoramicass.cpp which is the main code, from where all the reconstruction process takes palce.
To run the code, there are several arguments which can be used to specify how the reconstruction has to be done or where you can find the relevant images to stitch.
